# Human Movement Detection

## Description
This project detects and classifies human movements such as sit-ups, vertical jumps, and shuttle runs using computer vision and machine learning techniques. The system uses pre-recorded videos from the internet to train and test the model, providing accurate movement analysis without additional hardware.

## Features
- Detects sit-ups, vertical jumps, and shuttle runs
- Works with pre-recorded videos for training and testing
- Real-time movement detection simulation
- Provides movement count and basic analytics

## Tech Stack
- Python
- OpenCV (for video processing)
- MediaPipe (for pose and movement tracking)
- TensorFlow / Scikit-learn (for ML model training)
- NumPy & Pandas (for data handling)

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/human-movement-detection.git
